### Important Note:
#### Problem with Pointer variable:
The main.js file code is still not fixed due to a problem caused by a pointer variable. I'm understanding
that when I create an object that contains the new employ info, inside him, everytime that I will need to
create a new one, the user id will be still pointed to the  earlier employ.
